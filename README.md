## What is Beat Maker
Beat Maker is a browser application in development. The goal of this project is for a user to be able to create their own Beat Saber song charts using minimal outside resources

## What Can This Tool Do

## What CAN'T This Tool Do
This tool will not be able to edit audio files, create custom cover art, or package the final product. It is simply a chart creation tool. 

## How Do I Make A Good Beat Saber Chart
Practice, practice, practice! Beat Saber charting, while simplistic, does have a bit of a learning curve, especially since creating the chart in a 2D medium doesn't always translate perfectly to a VR game. You may think that your chart map looks great, only to find that playing it is a nightmare. These charts require lots of minute tweaking and playtesting, and often it's best to have a buddy playtest the chart for you, to get past your own chart blindness.  
The <a href="https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#mapping-quick-start">BSMG Wiki</a> has lots of helpful tools to get you started.

## How Can I Add This Chart Data To MY Beat Saber Game?
There are plenty of resources out there to assist with packaging the final product. In short, a Beat Saber track MUST have:  
*  info.dat
*  song.ogg OR song.egg
*  cover.jpg
*  Chart data, as listed in the info.dat file

These are the MINIMUM required files.  
Additionally, as of this writing, adding custom charts is not natively supported. You will need to mod your game, and as modding does come with certain inherent risks, I will not endorse a specific mod over another. However, a simple internet search will present a few good options.

## Author Recommended Editing Tools
*  <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">paint.NET</a> for cover art editing and saving
*  <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> for audio file editing
*  <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a> if there are any last-minute finishing touches needed for the file data  
Note: these recommendations come from my own personal experiences. There may be much better tools out there to get the specific jobs done; however these three were my personal favorites when I manually created charts in the past.
